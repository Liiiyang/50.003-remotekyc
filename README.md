Current Know-your-customer (KYC) processes typically require a Faceto-face
(F2F) verification whereby a human needs to verify the identity of
a person (e.g. passport and NRIC) against their physical identity. The
goal of this project is to design an application/software that allows a
company to verify the identification of a person with confidence.
